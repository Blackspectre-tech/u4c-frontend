                        United 4 Change is a game-changing donation platform for
                        nonprofits that provides transparency and accountability
                        to donors by sharing financial information and direct
                        project results in real-time. We understood the impact
                        blockchain technology could have on many of the pain
                        points nonprofits often suffer: lower costs in fees,
                        faster transaction times, precise tracking of donor
                        funds from beginning to end, and removal of misuse of
                        funds.

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>What is the mission of United4Change?</h4>
                <p>
                  Our mission is to connect donors directly to grassroots causes
                  through transparent, secure giving, using digital tools that
                  ensure funds are used responsibly and visibly.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>
                  Is United4Change affiliated with any specific organization?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  United4Change operates independently but works with verified
                  nonprofits and local organizations that align with our values.
                  We ensure every partner is vetted and community-focused.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Can I see the impact of my donation?</h4>
                <p>
                  Yes. Every campaign provides updates, milestones, and visual
                  evidence of progress. You'll also see exactly when your
                  contribution is released.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Why does United4Change use digital cash?</h4>
                <p>
                  Digital cash (like digital dollars or eNaira equivalents)
                  allows us to send donations directly to secure vaults, without
                  middlemen or delays. It also reduces fees and improves
                  tracking.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>How do I donate?</h4>
                <p>
                  It's simple. Choose a campaign and donate using your bank
                  card, transfer, or digital cash. You'll receive confirmation
                  and can track your donation in real time.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>What forms of digital cash can I donate with?</h4>
                <p>
                  We currently accept trusted digital currencies such as USDC,
                  USDT, and others â€” all stable, reliable, and always equal to a
                  fixed value. More options will be added soon.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Is my donation safe?</h4>
                <p>
                  Yes. All donations are secured in digital vaults powered by
                  automated systems. Funds are only released when milestones are
                  confirmed. Everything is transparent and traceable.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Can I remain anonymous when donating?</h4>
                <p>
                  Absolutely. You can choose to give privately or publicly.
                  Either way, you'll still be able to track how your donation
                  was used.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>
                  I've never used digital giving before. Can I still support a
                  cause?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Definitely. You can use your regular bank card or transfer. If
                  you'd like to try digital cash, we'll guide you step-by-step.
                </p>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Where does my donation go?</h4>
                <p>
                  Directly to the campaign you choose. Your donation is stored
                  securely and released only when results are verified.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Is my donation tax-deductible?</h4>
                <p>
                  We're working on enabling tax-deduction options in more
                  countries. In the meantime, we recommend consulting your local
                  tax advisor.
